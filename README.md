International Animal Trade Analysis
Description and Goals:
1) Apply graph theory to find degree of separation among countries based on animal genus and trading quantity. And how policy affect degree of separation through out time. I expect globalization will reduce degree of separation with exception of some policy banning wild animal trade.
2) I will also try looking for possible pattern/label between animals with other clustering techniques. Some result could be useful for giving policy decision recommendation (Setting quota for animals trade quantity).
3) What is more, I can also use time series model to predict captive bred animal trade quantity between countries. Wild animal trade is too sensitive to policy change, so harder to predict.

How to present: slides
What are your data source: https://trade.cites.org/#
Next Steps: I will download all available data from the website and start some EDA. Also, I will read some paper of graph theory, especially how to apply graph theory to international trade.
